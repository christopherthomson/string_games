       "'\\nAt the Bay\\nI\\nVery early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of\\nCrescent Bay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered\\nhills at the back were smothered. You could not see where they ended\\nand the paddocks and bungalows began. The sandy road was gone and the\\npaddocks and bungalows the other side of it; there were no white dunes\\ncovered with reddish grass beyond them; there was nothing to mark which\\nwas beach and where was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was\\nblue. Big drops hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery,\\nfluffy toi-toi was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and\\nthe pinks in the bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness.\\nDrenched were the cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat\\nnasturtium leaves. It looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in\\nthe darkness, as though one immense wave had come rippling,\\nrippling—how far? Perhaps if you had waked up in the middle of the\\nnight you might have seen a big fish flicking in at the window and gone\\nagain....\\nAh-Aah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came the sound\\nof little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping between the\\nsmooth stones, gushing into ferny basins and out again; and there was\\nthe splashing of big drops on large leaves, and something else—what was\\nit?—a faint stirring and shaking, the snapping of a twig and then such\\nsilence that it seemed some one was listening.\\nRound the corner of Crescent Bay, between the piled-up masses of broken\\nrock, a flock of sheep came pattering. They were huddled together, a\\nsmall, tossing, woolly mass, and their thin, stick-like legs trotted\\nalong quickly as if the cold and the quiet had frightened them. Behind\\nthem an old sheep-dog, his soaking paws covered with sand, ran along\\nwith his nose to the ground, but carelessly, as if thinking of\\nsomething else. And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself\\nappeared. He was a lean, upright old man, in a frieze coat that was\\ncovered with a web of tiny drops, velvet trousers tied under the knee,\\nand a wide-awake with a folded blue handkerchief round the brim. One\\nhand was crammed into his belt, the other grasped a beautifully smooth\\nyellow stick. And as he walked, taking his time, he kept up a very soft\\nlight whistling, an airy, far-away fluting that sounded mournful and\\ntender. The old dog cut an ancient caper or two and then drew up sharp,\\nashamed of his levity, and walked a few dignified paces by his master’s\\nside. The sheep ran forward in little pattering rushes; they began to\\nbleat, and ghostly flocks and herds answered them from under the sea.\\n“Baa! Baaa!” For a time they seemed to be always on the same piece of\\nground. There ahead was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles;\\nthe same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy\\npalings. Then something immense came into view; an enormous\\nshock-haired giant with his arms stretched out. It was the big gum-tree\\noutside Mrs. Stubbs’ shop, and as they passed by there was a strong\\nwhiff of eucalyptus. And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.\\nThe shepherd stopped whistling; he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on\\nhis wet sleeve and, screwing up his eyes, glanced in the direction of\\nthe sea. The sun was rising. It was marvellous how quickly the mist\\nthinned, sped away, dissolved from the shallow plain, rolled up from\\nthe bush and was gone as if in a hurry to escape; big twists and curls\\njostled and shouldered each other as the silvery beams broadened. The\\nfar-away sky—a bright, pure blue—was reflected in the puddles, and the\\ndrops, swimming along the telegraph poles, flashed into points of\\nlight. Now the leaping, glittering sea was so bright it made one’s eyes\\nache to look at it. The shepherd drew a pipe, the bowl as small as an\\nacorn, out of his breast pocket, fumbled for a chunk of speckled\\ntobacco, pared off a few shavings and stuffed the bowl. He was a grave,\\nfine-looking old man. As he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his\\nhead, the dog, watching, looked proud of him.\\n“Baa! Baaa!” The sheep spread out into a fan. They were just clear of\\nthe summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a\\ndrowsy head; their cry sounded in the dreams of little children… who\\nlifted their arms to drag down, to cuddle the darling little woolly\\nlambs of sleep. Then the first inhabitant appeared; it was the\\nBurnells’ cat Florrie, sitting on the gatepost, far too early as usual,\\nlooking for their milk-girl. When she saw the old sheep-dog she sprang\\nup quickly, arched her back, drew in her tabby head, and seemed to give\\na little fastidious shiver. “Ugh! What a coarse, revolting creature!”\\nsaid Florrie. But the old sheep-dog, not looking up, waggled past,\\nflinging out his legs from side to side. Only one of his ears twitched\\nto prove that he saw, and thought her a silly young female.\\nThe breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and\\nwet black earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea. Myriads of\\nbirds were singing. A goldfinch flew over the shepherd’s head and,\\nperching on the tiptop of a spray, it turned to the sun, ruffling its\\nsmall breast feathers. And now they had passed the fisherman’s hut,\\npassed the charred-looking little whare where Leila the milk-girl\\nlived with her old Gran. The sheep strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag,\\nthe sheep-dog, padded after, rounded them up and headed them for the\\nsteeper, narrower rocky pass that led out of Crescent Bay and towards\\nDaylight Cove. “Baa! Baa!” Faint the cry came as they rocked along the\\nfast-drying road. The shepherd put away his pipe, dropping it into his\\nbreast-pocket so that the little bowl hung over. And straightway the\\nsoft airy whistling began again. Wag ran out along a ledge of rock\\nafter something that smelled, and ran back again disgusted. Then\\npushing, nudging, hurrying, the sheep rounded the bend and the shepherd\\nfollowed after out of sight.\\nII\\nA few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened, and a\\nfigure in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down the paddock, cleared\\nthe stile, rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow, staggered\\nup the sandy hillock, and raced for dear life over the big porous\\nstones, over the cold, wet pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed\\nlike oil. Splish-Splosh! Splish-Splosh! The water bubbled round his\\nlegs as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting. First man in as usual! He’d\\nbeaten them all again. And he swooped down to souse his head and neck.\\n“Hail, brother! All hail, Thou Mighty One!” A velvety bass voice came\\nbooming over the water.\\nGreat Scott! Damnation take it! Stanley lifted up to see a dark head\\nbobbing far out and an arm lifted. It was Jonathan Trout—there before\\nhim! “Glorious morning!” sang the voice.\\n“Yes, very fine!” said Stanley briefly. Why the dickens didn’t the\\nfellow stick to his part of the sea? Why should he come barging over to\\nthis exact spot? Stanley gave a kick, a lunge and struck out, swimming\\noverarm. But Jonathan was a match for him. Up he came, his black hair\\nsleek on his forehead, his short beard sleek.\\n“I had an extraordinary dream last night!” he shouted.\\nWhat was the matter with the man? This mania for conversation irritated\\nStanley beyond words. And it was always the same—always some piffle\\nabout a dream he’d had, or some cranky idea he’d got hold of, or some\\nrot he’d been reading. Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with\\nhis legs till he was a living waterspout. But even then…. “I dreamed\\nI was hanging over a terrifically high cliff, shouting to some one\\nbelow.” You would be! thought Stanley. He could stick no more of it. He\\nstopped splashing. “Look here, Trout,” he said, “I’m in rather a hurry\\nthis morning.”\\n“You’re WHAT?” Jonathan was so surprised—or pretended to be—that he\\nsank under the water, then reappeared again blowing.\\n“All I mean is,” said Stanley, “I’ve no time to—to—to fool about. I\\nwant to get this over. I’m in a hurry. I’ve work to do this\\nmorning—see?”\\nJonathan was gone before Stanley had finished. “Pass, friend!” said the\\nbass voice gently, and he slid away through the water with scarcely a\\nripple…. But curse the fellow! He’d ruined Stanley’s bathe. What an\\nunpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again, and\\nthen as quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the beach. He felt\\ncheated.\\nJonathan stayed a little longer in the water. He floated, gently moving\\nhis hands like fins, and letting the sea rock his long, skinny body. It\\nwas curious, but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell.\\nTrue, he had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes, to poke fun at\\nhim, but at bottom he was sorry for the fellow. There was something\\npathetic in his determination to make a job of everything. You couldn’t\\nhelp feeling he’d be caught out one day, and then what an almighty\\ncropper he’d come! At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode\\npast him, and broke along the beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty!\\nAnd now there came another. That was the way to live—carelessly,\\nrecklessly, spending oneself. He got on to his feet and began to wade\\ntowards the shore, pressing his toes into the firm, wrinkled sand. To\\ntake things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of life, but to\\ngive way to it—that was what was needed. It was this tension that was\\nall wrong. To live—to live! And the perfect morning, so fresh and fair,\\nbasking in the light, as though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to\\nwhisper, “Why not?”\\nBut now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold. He\\nached all over; it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of\\nhim. And stalking up the beach, shivering, all his muscles tight, he\\ntoo felt his bathe was spoilt. He’d stayed in too long.\\nIII\\nBeryl was alone in the living-room when Stanley appeared, wearing a\\nblue serge suit, a stiff collar and a spotted tie. He looked almost\\nuncannily clean and brushed; he was going to town for the day. Dropping\\ninto his chair, he pulled out his watch and put it beside his plate.\\n“I’ve just got twenty-five minutes,” he said. “You might go and see if\\nthe porridge is ready, Beryl?”\\n“Mother’s just gone for it,” said Beryl. She sat down at the table and\\npoured out his tea.\\n“Thanks!” Stanley took a sip. “Hallo!” he said in an astonished voice,\\n“you’ve forgotten the sugar.”\\n“Oh, sorry!” But even then Beryl didn’t help him; she pushed the basin\\nacross. What did this mean? As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes\\nwidened; they seemed to quiver. He shot a quick glance at his\\nsister-in-law and leaned back.\\n“Nothing wrong, is there?” he asked carelessly, fingering his collar.\\nBeryl’s head was bent; she turned her plate in her fingers.\\n“Nothing,” said her light voice. Then she too looked up, and smiled at\\nStanley. “Why should there be?”\\n“O-oh! No reason at all as far as I know. I thought you seemed rather—”\\nAt that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared,\\neach carrying a porridge plate. They were dressed alike in blue jerseys\\nand knickers; their brown legs were bare, and each had her hair plaited\\nand pinned up in what was called a horse’s tail. Behind them came Mrs.\\nFairfield with the tray.\\n“Carefully, children,” she warned. But they were taking the very\\ngreatest care. They loved being allowed to carry things. “Have you said\\ngood morning to your father?”\\n“Yes, grandma.” They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley\\nand Beryl.\\n“Good morning, Stanley!” Old Mrs. Fairfield gave him his plate.\\n“Morning, mother! How’s the boy?”\\n“Splendid! He only woke up once last night. What a perfect morning!”\\nThe old woman paused, her hand on the loaf of bread, to gaze out of the\\nopen door into the garden. The sea sounded. Through the wide-open\\nwindow streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare\\nfloor. Everything on the table flashed and glittered. In the middle\\nthere was an old salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums. She\\nsmiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes.\\n“You might cut me a slice of that bread, mother,” said Stanley. “I’ve\\nonly twelve and a half minutes before the coach passes. Has anyone\\ngiven my shoes to the servant girl?”\\n“Yes, they’re ready for you.” Mrs. Fairfield was quite unruffled.\\n“Oh, Kezia! Why are you such a messy child!” cried Beryl despairingly.\\n“Me, Aunt Beryl?” Kezia stared at her. What had she done now? She had\\nonly dug a river down the middle of her porridge, filled it, and was\\neating the banks away. But she did that every single morning, and no\\none had said a word up till now.\\n“Why can’t you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie?” How\\nunfair grown-ups are!\\n“But Lottie always makes a floating island, don’t you, Lottie?”\\n“I don’t,” said Isabel smartly. “I just sprinkle mine with sugar and\\nput on the milk and finish it. Only babies play with their food.”\\nStanley pushed back his chair and got up.\\n“Would you get me those shoes, mother? And, Beryl, if you’ve finished,\\nI wish you’d cut down to the gate and stop the coach. Run in to your\\nmother, Isabel, and ask her where my bowler hat’s been put. Wait a\\nminute—have you children been playing with my stick?”\\n“No, father!”\\n“But I put it here.” Stanley began to bluster. “I remember distinctly\\nputting it in this corner. Now, who’s had it? There’s no time to lose.\\nLook sharp! The stick’s got to be found.”\\nEven Alice, the servant-girl, was drawn into the chase. “You haven’t\\nbeen using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?”\\nStanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying. “Most\\nextraordinary thing. I can’t keep a single possession to myself.\\nThey’ve made away with my stick, now!”\\n“Stick, dear? What stick?” Linda’s vagueness on these occasions could\\nnot be real, Stanley decided. Would nobody sympathize with him?\\n“Coach! Coach, Stanley!” Beryl’s voice cried from the gate.\\nStanley waved his arm to Linda. “No time to say good-bye!” he cried.\\nAnd he meant that as a punishment to her.\\nHe snatched his bowler hat, dashed out of the house, and swung down the\\ngarden path. Yes, the coach was there waiting, and Beryl, leaning over\\nthe open gate, was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing\\nhad happened. The heartlessness of women! The way they took it for\\ngranted it was your job to slave away for them while they didn’t even\\ntake the trouble to see that your walking-stick wasn’t lost. Kelly\\ntrailed his whip across the horses.\\n“Good-bye, Stanley,” called Beryl, sweetly and gaily. It was easy\\nenough to say good-bye! And there she stood, idle, shading her eyes\\nwith her hand. The worst of it was Stanley had to shout good-bye too,\\nfor the sake of appearances. Then he saw her turn, give a little skip\\nand run back to the house. She was glad to be rid of him!\\nYes, she was thankful. Into the living-room she ran and called “He’s\\ngone!” Linda cried from her room: “Beryl! Has Stanley gone?” Old Mrs.\\nFairfield appeared, carrying the boy in his little flannel coatee.\\n“Gone?”\\n“Gone!”\\nOh, the relief, the difference it made to have the man out of the\\nhouse. Their very voices were changed as they called to one another;\\nthey sounded warm and loving and as if they shared a secret. Beryl went\\nover to the table. “Have another cup of tea, mother. It’s still hot.”\\nShe wanted, somehow, to celebrate the fact that they could do what they\\nliked now. There was no man to disturb them; the whole perfect day was\\ntheirs.\\n“No, thank you, child,” said old Mrs. Fairfield, but the way at that\\nmoment she tossed the boy up and said “a-goos-a-goos-a-ga!” to him\\nmeant that she felt the same. The little girls ran into the paddock\\nlike chickens let out of a coop.\\nEven Alice, the servant-girl, washing up the dishes in the kitchen,\\ncaught the infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly\\nreckless fashion.\\n“Oh, these men!” said she, and she plunged the teapot into the bowl and\\nheld it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling, as if it\\ntoo was a man and drowning was too good for them.\\nIV\\n“Wait for me, Isa-bel! Kezia, wait for me!”\\nThere was poor little Lottie, left behind again, because she found it\\nso fearfully hard to get over the stile by herself. When she stood on\\nthe first step her knees began to wobble; she grasped the post. Then\\nyou had to put one leg over. But which leg? She never could decide. And\\nwhen she did finally put one leg over with a sort of stamp of\\ndespair—then the feeling was awful. She was half in the paddock still\\nand half in the tussock grass. She clutched the post desperately and\\nlifted up her voice. “Wait for me!”\\n“No, don’t you wait for her, Kezia!” said Isabel. “She’s such a little\\nsilly. She’s always making a fuss. Come on!” And she tugged Kezia’s\\njersey. “You can use my bucket if you come with me,” she said kindly.\\n“It’s bigger than yours.” But Kezia couldn’t leave Lottie all by\\nherself. She ran back to her. By this time Lottie was very red in the\\nface and breathing heavily.\\n“Here, put your other foot over,” said Kezia.\\n“Where?”\\nLottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height.\\n“Here where my hand is.” Kezia patted the place.\\n“Oh, there do you mean!” Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the second\\nfoot over.\\n“Now—sort of turn round and sit down and slide,” said Kezia.\\n“But there’s nothing to sit down on, Kezia,” said Lottie.\\nShe managed it at last, and once it was over she shook herself and\\nbegan to beam.\\n“I’m getting better at climbing over stiles, aren’t I, Kezia?”\\nLottie’s was a very hopeful nature.\\nThe pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabel’s bright red sunbonnet\\nup that sliding, slipping hill. At the top they paused to decide where\\nto go and to have a good stare at who was there already. Seen from\\nbehind, standing against the skyline, gesticulating largely with their\\nspades, they looked like minute puzzled explorers.\\nThe whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their\\nlady-help, who sat on a camp-stool and kept order with a whistle that\\nshe wore tied round her neck, and a small cane with which she directed\\noperations. The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed\\ntheir own game. If they did, it ended in the boys pouring water down\\nthe girls’ necks or the girls trying to put little black crabs into the\\nboys’ pockets. So Mrs. S. J. and the poor lady-help drew up what she\\ncalled a “brogramme” every morning to keep them “abused and out of\\nbischief.” It was all competitions or races or round games. Everything\\nbegan with a piercing blast of the lady-help’s whistle and ended with\\nanother. There were even prizes—large, rather dirty paper parcels which\\nthe lady-help with a sour little smile drew out of a bulging string\\nkit. The Samuel Josephs fought fearfully for the prizes and cheated and\\npinched one another’s arms—they were all expert pinchers. The only time\\nthe Burnell children ever played with them Kezia had got a prize, and\\nwhen she undid three bits of paper she found a very small rusty\\nbutton-hook. She couldn’t understand why they made such a fuss….\\nBut they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their\\nparties. The Samuel Josephs were always giving children’s parties at\\nthe Bay and there was always the same food. A big washhand basin of\\nvery brown fruit-salad, buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of\\nsomething the lady-help called “Limmonadear.” And you went away in the\\nevening with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled\\nall down the front of your open-work pinafore, leaving the Samuel\\nJosephs leaping like savages on their lawn. No! They were too awful.\\nOn the other side of the beach, close down to the water, two little\\nboys, their knickers rolled up, twinkled like spiders. One was digging,\\nthe other pattered in and out of the water, filling a small bucket.\\nThey were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags. But Pip was so busy digging and\\nRags was so busy helping that they didn’t see their little cousins\\nuntil they were quite close.\\n“Look!” said Pip. “Look what I’ve discovered.” And he showed them an\\nold wet, squashed-looking boot. The three little girls stared.\\n“Whatever are you going to do with it?” asked Kezia.\\n“Keep it, of course!” Pip was very scornful. “It’s a find—see?”\\nYes, Kezia saw that. All the same….\\n“There’s lots of things buried in the sand,” explained Pip. “They get\\nchucked up from wrecks. Treasure. Why—you might find—”\\n“But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in?” asked Lottie.\\n“Oh, that’s to moisten it,” said Pip, “to make the work a bit easier.\\nKeep it up, Rags.”\\nAnd good little Rags ran up and down, pouring in the water that turned\\nbrown like cocoa.\\n“Here, shall I show you what I found yesterday?” said Pip mysteriously,\\nand he stuck his spade into the sand. “Promise not to tell.”\\nThey promised.\\n“Say, cross my heart straight dinkum.”\\nThe little girls said it.\\nPip took something out of his pocket, rubbed it a long time on the\\nfront of his jersey, then breathed on it and rubbed it again.\\n“Now turn round!” he ordered.\\nThey turned round.\\n“All look the same way! Keep still! Now!”\\nAnd his hand opened; he held up to the light something that flashed,\\nthat winked, that was a most lovely green.\\n“It’s a nemeral,” said Pip solemnly.\\n“Is it really, Pip?” Even Isabel was impressed.\\nThe lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pip’s fingers. Aunt Beryl had\\na nemeral in a ring, but it was a very small one. This one was as big\\nas a star and far more beautiful.\\nV\\nAs the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sand-hills\\nand came down on the beach to bathe. It was understood that at eleven\\no’clock the women and children of the summer colony had the sea to\\nthemselves. First the women undressed, pulled on their bathing dresses\\nand covered their heads in hideous caps like sponge bags; then the\\nchildren were unbuttoned. The beach was strewn with little heaps of\\nclothes and shoes; the big summer hats, with stones on them to keep\\nthem from blowing away, looked like immense shells. It was strange that\\neven the sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping,\\nlaughing figures ran into the waves. Old Mrs. Fairfield, in a lilac\\ncotton dress and a black hat tied under the chin, gathered her little\\nbrood and got them ready. The little Trout boys whipped their shirts\\nover their heads, and away the five sped, while their grandma sat with\\none hand in her knitting-bag ready to draw out the ball of wool when\\nshe was satisfied they were safely in.\\nThe firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender,\\ndelicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering, crouching down,\\nslapping the water, never hesitated. But Isabel, who could swim twelve\\nstrokes, and Kezia, who could nearly swim eight, only followed on the\\nstrict understanding they were not to be splashed. As for Lottie, she\\ndidn’t follow at all. She liked to be left to go in her own way,\\nplease. And that way was to sit down at the edge of the water, her legs\\nstraight, her knees pressed together, and to make vague motions with\\nher arms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea. But when a bigger\\nwave than usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in her\\ndirection, she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up\\nthe beach again.\\n“Here, mother, keep those for me, will you?”\\nTwo rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfield’s lap.\\n“Yes, dear. But aren’t you going to bathe here?”\\n“No-o,” Beryl drawled. She sounded vague. “I’m undressing farther\\nalong. I’m going to bathe with Mrs. Harry Kember.”\\n“Very well.” But Mrs. Fairfield’s lips set. She disapproved of Mrs\\nHarry Kember. Beryl knew it.\\nPoor old mother, she smiled, as she skimmed over the stones. Poor old\\nmother! Old! Oh, what joy, what bliss it was to be young….\\n“You look very pleased,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. She sat hunched up on\\nthe stones, her arms round her knees, smoking.\\n“It’s such a lovely day,” said Beryl, smiling down at her.\\n“Oh my dear!” Mrs. Harry Kember’s voice sounded as though she knew\\nbetter than that. But then her voice always sounded as though she knew\\nsomething better about you than you did yourself. She was a long,\\nstrange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. Her face, too, was\\nlong and narrow and exhausted-looking; even her fair curled fringe\\nlooked burnt out and withered. She was the only woman at the Bay who\\nsmoked, and she smoked incessantly, keeping the cigarette between her\\nlips while she talked, and only taking it out when the ash was so long\\nyou could not understand why it did not fall. When she was not playing\\nbridge—she played bridge every day of her life—she spent her time lying\\nin the full glare of the sun. She could stand any amount of it; she\\nnever had enough. All the same, it did not seem to warm her. Parched,\\nwithered, cold, she lay stretched on the stones like a piece of\\ntossed-up driftwood. The women at the Bay thought she was very, very\\nfast. Her lack of vanity, her slang, the way she treated men as though\\nshe was one of them, and the fact that she didn’t care twopence about\\nher house and called the servant Gladys “Glad-eyes,” was disgraceful.\\nStanding on the veranda steps Mrs. Kember would call in her\\nindifferent, tired voice, “I say, Glad-eyes, you might heave me a\\nhandkerchief if I’ve got one, will you?” And Glad-eyes, a red bow in\\nher hair instead of a cap, and white shoes, came running with an\\nimpudent smile. It was an absolute scandal! True, she had no children,\\nand her husband…. Here the voices were always raised; they became\\nfervent. How can he have married her? How can he, how can he? It must\\nhave been money, of course, but even then!\\nMrs. Kember’s husband was at least ten years younger than she was, and\\nso incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect\\nillustration in an American novel rather than a man. Black hair, dark\\nblue eyes, red lips, a slow sleepy smile, a fine tennis player, a\\nperfect dancer, and with it all a mystery. Harry Kember was like a man\\nwalking in his sleep. Men couldn’t stand him, they couldn’t get a word\\nout of the chap; he ignored his wife just as she ignored him. How did\\nhe live? Of course there were stories, but such stories! They simply\\ncouldn’t be told. The women he’d been seen with, the places he’d been\\nseen in… but nothing was ever certain, nothing definite. Some of the\\nwomen at the Bay privately thought he’d commit a murder one day. Yes,\\neven while they talked to Mrs. Kember and took in the awful concoction\\nshe was wearing, they saw her, stretched as she lay on the beach; but\\ncold, bloody, and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her\\nmouth.\\nMrs. Kember rose, yawned, unsnapped her belt buckle, and tugged at the\\ntape of her blouse. And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her\\njersey, and stood up in her short white petticoat, and her camisole\\nwith ribbon bows on the shoulders.\\n“Mercy on us,” said Mrs. Harry Kember, “what a little beauty you are!”\\n“Don’t!” said Beryl softly; but, drawing off one stocking and then the\\nother, she felt a little beauty.\\n“My dear—why not?” said Mrs. Harry Kember, stamping on her own\\npetticoat. Really—her underclothes! A pair of blue cotton knickers and\\na linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillow-case…. “And you\\ndon’t wear stays, do you?” She touched Beryl’s waist, and Beryl sprang\\naway with a small affected cry. Then “Never!” she said firmly.\\n“Lucky little creature,” sighed Mrs. Kember, unfastening her own.\\nBeryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one\\nwho is trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathing-dress\\nall at one and the same time.\\n“Oh, my dear—don’t mind me,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. “Why be shy? I\\nshan’t eat you. I shan’t be shocked like those other ninnies.” And she\\ngave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.\\nBut Beryl was shy. She never undressed in front of anybody. Was that\\nsilly? Mrs. Harry Kember made her feel it was silly, even something to\\nbe ashamed of. Why be shy indeed! She glanced quickly at her friend\\nstanding so boldly in her torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette;\\nand a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast. Laughing\\nrecklessly, she drew on the limp, sandy-feeling bathing-dress that was\\nnot quite dry and fastened the twisted buttons.\\n“That’s better,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. They began to go down the\\nbeach together. “Really, it’s a sin for you to wear clothes, my dear.\\nSomebody’s got to tell you some day.”\\nThe water was quite warm. It was that marvellous transparent blue,\\nflecked with silver, but the sand at the bottom looked gold; when you\\nkicked with your toes there rose a little puff of gold-dust. Now the\\nwaves just reached her breast. Beryl stood, her arms outstretched,\\ngazing out, and as each wave came she gave the slightest little jump,\\nso that it seemed it was the wave which lifted her so gently.\\n“I believe in pretty girls having a good time,” said Mrs. Harry Kember.\\n“Why not? Don’t you make a mistake, my dear. Enjoy yourself.” And\\nsuddenly she turned turtle, disappeared, and swam away quickly,\\nquickly, like a rat. Then she flicked round and began swimming back.\\nShe was going to say something else. Beryl felt that she was being\\npoisoned by this cold woman, but she longed to hear. But oh, how\\nstrange, how horrible! As Mrs. Harry Kember came up close she looked,\\nin her black waterproof bathing-cap, with her sleepy face lifted above\\nthe water, just her chin touching, like a horrible caricature of her\\nhusband.\\nVI\\nIn a steamer chair, under a manuka tree that grew in the middle of the\\nfront grass patch, Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away. She did\\nnothing. She looked up at the dark, close, dry leaves of the manuka, at\\nthe chinks of blue between, and now and again a tiny yellowish flower\\ndropped on her. Pretty—yes, if you held one of those flowers on the\\npalm of your hand and looked at it closely, it was an exquisite small\\nthing. Each pale yellow petal shone as if each was the careful work of\\na loving hand. The tiny tongue in the centre gave it the shape of a\\nbell. And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.\\nBut as soon as they flowered, they fell and were scattered. You brushed\\nthem off your frock as you talked; the horrid little things got caught\\nin one’s hair. Why, then, flower at all? Who takes the trouble—or the\\njoy—to make all these things that are wasted, wasted…. It was\\nuncanny.\\nOn the grass beside her, lying between two pillows, was the boy. Sound\\nasleep he lay, his head turned away from his mother. His fine dark hair\\nlooked more like a shadow than like real hair, but his ear was a\\nbright, deep coral. Linda clasped her hands above her head and crossed\\nher feet. It was very pleasant to know that all these bungalows were\\nempty, that everybody was down on the beach, out of sight, out of\\nhearing. She had the garden to herself; she was alone.\\nDazzling white the picotees shone; the golden-eyed marigold glittered;\\nthe nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. If\\nonly one had time to look at these flowers long enough, time to get\\nover the sense of novelty and strangeness, time to know them! But as\\nsoon as one paused to part the petals, to discover the under-side of\\nthe leaf, along came Life and one was swept away. And, lying in her\\ncane chair, Linda felt so light; she felt like a leaf. Along came Life\\nlike a wind and she was seized and shaken; she had to go. Oh dear,\\nwould it always be so? Was there no escape?\\n… Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home, leaning against\\nher father’s knee. And he promised, “As soon as you and I are old\\nenough, Linny, we’ll cut off somewhere, we’ll escape. Two boys\\ntogether. I have a fancy I’d like to sail up a river in China.” Linda\\nsaw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. She saw\\nthe yellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high, thin voices as\\nthey called….\\n“Yes, papa.”\\nBut just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked\\nslowly past their house, and slowly, solemnly even, uncovered. Linda’s\\nfather pulled her ear teasingly, in the way he had.\\n“Linny’s beau,” he whispered.\\n“Oh, papa, fancy being married to Stanley Burnell!”\\nWell, she was married to him. And what was more she loved him. Not the\\nStanley whom every one saw, not the everyday one; but a timid,\\nsensitive, innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his\\nprayers, and who longed to be good. Stanley was simple. If he believed\\nin people—as he believed in her, for instance—it was with his whole\\nheart. He could not be disloyal; he could not tell a lie. And how\\nterribly he suffered if he thought anyone—she—was not being dead\\nstraight, dead sincere with him! “This is too subtle for me!” He flung\\nout the words, but his open, quivering, distraught look was like the\\nlook of a trapped beast.\\nBut the trouble was—here Linda felt almost inclined to laugh, though\\nHeaven knows it was no laughing matter—she saw her Stanley so seldom.\\nThere were glimpses, moments, breathing spaces of calm, but all the\\nrest of the time it was like living in a house that couldn’t be cured\\nof the habit of catching on fire, on a ship that got wrecked every day.\\nAnd it was always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger. Her whole\\ntime was spent in rescuing him, and restoring him, and calming him\\ndown, and listening to his story. And what was left of her time was\\nspent in the dread of having children.\\nLinda frowned; she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her\\nankles. Yes, that was her real grudge against life; that was what she\\ncould not understand. That was the question she asked and asked, and\\nlistened in vain for the answer. It was all very well to say it was the\\ncommon lot of women to bear children. It wasn’t true. She, for one,\\ncould prove that wrong. She was broken, made weak, her courage was\\ngone, through child-bearing. And what made it doubly hard to bear was,\\nshe did not love her children. It was useless pretending. Even if she\\nhad had the strength she never would have nursed and played with the\\nlittle girls. No, it was as though a cold breath had chilled her\\nthrough and through on each of those awful journeys; she had no warmth\\nleft to give them. As to the boy—well, thank Heaven, mother had taken\\nhim; he was mother’s, or Beryl’s, or anybody’s who wanted him. She had\\nhardly held him in her arms. She was so indifferent about him that as\\nhe lay there… Linda glanced down.\\nThe boy had turned over. He lay facing her, and he was no longer\\nasleep. His dark-blue, baby eyes were open; he looked as though he was\\npeeping at his mother. And suddenly his face dimpled; it broke into a\\nwide, toothless smile, a perfect beam, no less.\\n“I’m here!” that happy smile seemed to say. “Why don’t you like me?”\\nThere was something so quaint, so unexpected about that smile that\\nLinda smiled herself. But she checked herself and said to the boy\\ncoldly, “I don’t like babies.”\\n“Don’t like babies?” The boy couldn’t believe her. “Don’t like me?”\\nHe waved his arms foolishly at his mother.\\nLinda dropped off her chair on to the grass.\\n“Why do you keep on smiling?” she said severely. “If you knew what I\\nwas thinking about, you wouldn’t.”\\nBut he only squeezed up his eyes, slyly, and rolled his head on the\\npillow. He didn’t believe a word she said.\\n“We know all about that!” smiled the boy.\\nLinda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature….\\nAh no, be sincere. That was not what she felt; it was something far\\ndifferent, it was something so new, so…. The tears danced in her\\neyes; she breathed in a small whisper to the boy, “Hallo, my funny!”\\nBut by now the boy had forgotten his mother. He was serious again.\\nSomething pink, something soft waved in front of him. He made a grab at\\nit and it immediately disappeared. But when he lay back, another, like\\nthe first, appeared. This time he determined to catch it. He made a\\ntremendous effort and rolled right over.\\nVII\\nThe tide was out; the beach was deserted; lazily flopped the warm sea.\\nThe sun beat down, beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand, baking the\\ngrey and blue and black and white-veined pebbles. It sucked up the\\nlittle drop of water that lay in the hollow of the curved shells; it\\nbleached the pink convolvulus that threaded through and through the\\nsand-hills. Nothing seemed to move but the small sand-hoppers.\\nPit-pit-pit! They were never still.\\nOver there on the weed-hung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy\\nbeasts come down to the water to drink, the sunlight seemed to spin\\nlike a silver coin dropped into each of the small rock pools. They\\ndanced, they quivered, and minute ripples laved the porous shores.\\nLooking down, bending over, each pool was like a lake with pink and\\nblue houses clustered on the shores; and oh! the vast mountainous\\ncountry behind those houses—the ravines, the passes, the dangerous\\ncreeks and fearful tracks that led to the water’s edge. Underneath\\nwaved the sea-forest—pink thread-like trees, velvet anemones, and\\norange berry-spotted weeds. Now a stone on the bottom moved, rocked,\\nand there was a glimpse of a black feeler; now a thread-like creature\\nwavered by and was lost. Something was happening to the pink, waving\\ntrees; they were changing to a cold moonlight blue. And now there\\nsounded the faintest “plop.” Who made that sound? What was going on\\ndown there? And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot\\nsun….\\nThe green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony. Over\\nthe verandas, prone on the paddock, flung over the fences, there were\\nexhausted-looking bathing-dresses and rough striped towels. Each back\\nwindow seemed to have a pair of sand-shoes on the sill and some lumps\\nof rock or a bucket or a collection of pawa shells. The bush quivered\\nin a haze of heat; the sandy road was empty except for the Trouts’ dog\\nSnooker, who lay stretched in the very middle of it. His blue eye was\\nturned up, his legs stuck out stiffly, and he gave an occasional\\ndesperate-sounding puff, as much as to say he had decided to make an\\nend of it and was only waiting for some kind cart to come along.\\n“What are you looking at, my grandma? Why do you keep stopping and sort\\nof staring at the wall?”\\nKezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together. The little\\ngirl, wearing only her short drawers and her under-bodice, her arms and\\nlegs bare, lay on one of the puffed-up pillows of her grandma’s bed,\\nand the old woman, in a white ruffled dressing-gown, sat in a rocker at\\nthe window, with a long piece of pink knitting in her lap. This room\\nthat they shared, like the other rooms of the bungalow, was of light\\nvarnished wood and the floor was bare. The furniture was of the\\nshabbiest, the simplest. The dressing-table, for instance, was a\\npacking-case in a sprigged muslin petticoat, and the mirror above was\\nvery strange; it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was\\nimprisoned in it. On the table there stood a jar of sea-pinks, pressed\\nso tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion, and a\\nspecial shell which Kezia had given her grandma for a pin-tray, and\\nanother even more special which she had thought would make a very nice\\nplace for a watch to curl up in.\\n“Tell me, grandma,” said Kezia.\\nThe old woman sighed, whipped the wool twice round her thumb, and drew\\nthe bone needle through. She was casting on.\\n“I was thinking of your Uncle William, darling,” she said quietly.\\n“My Australian Uncle William?” said Kezia. She had another.\\n“Yes, of course.”\\n“The one I never saw?”\\n“That was the one.”\\n“Well, what happened to him?” Kezia knew perfectly well, but she wanted\\nto be told again.\\n“He went to the mines, and he got a sunstroke there and died,” said old\\nMrs. Fairfield.\\nKezia blinked and considered the picture again…. A little man fallen\\nover like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole.\\n“Does it make you sad to think about him, grandma?” She hated her\\ngrandma to be sad.\\nIt was the old woman’s turn to consider. Did it make her sad? To look\\nback, back. To stare down the years, as Kezia had seen her doing. To\\nlook after them as a woman does, long after they were out of sight.\\nDid it make her sad? No, life was like that.\\n“No, Kezia.”\\n“But why?” asked Kezia. She lifted one bare arm and began to draw\\nthings in the air. “Why did Uncle William have to die? He wasn’t old.”\\nMrs. Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes. “It just\\nhappened,” she said in an absorbed voice.\\n“Does everybody have to die?” asked Kezia.\\n“Everybody!”\\n“Me?” Kezia sounded fearfully incredulous.\\n“Some day, my darling.”\\n“But, grandma.” Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes. They\\nfelt sandy. “What if I just won’t?”\\nThe old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball.\\n“We’re not asked, Kezia,” she said sadly. “It happens to all of us\\nsooner or later.”\\nKezia lay still thinking this over. She didn’t want to die. It meant\\nshe would have to leave here, leave everywhere, for ever, leave—leave\\nher grandma. She rolled over quickly.\\n“Grandma,” she said in a startled voice.\\n“What, my pet!”\\n“You’re not to die.” Kezia was very decided.\\n“Ah, Kezia”—her grandma looked up and smiled and shook her head—“don’t\\nlet’s talk about it.”\\n“But you’re not to. You couldn’t leave me. You couldn’t not be there.”\\nThis was awful. “Promise me you won’t ever do it, grandma,” pleaded\\nKezia.\\nThe old woman went on knitting.\\n“Promise me! Say never!”\\nBut still her grandma was silent.\\nKezia rolled off her bed; she couldn’t bear it any longer, and lightly\\nshe leapt on to her grandma’s knees, clasped her hands round the old\\nwoman’s throat and began kissing her, under the chin, behind the ear,\\nand blowing down her neck.\\n“Say never… say never… say never—” She gasped between the kisses.\\nAnd then she began, very softly and lightly, to tickle her grandma.\\n“Kezia!” The old woman dropped her knitting. She swung back in the\\nrocker. She began to tickle Kezia. “Say never, say never, say never,”\\ngurgled Kezia, while they lay there laughing in each other’s arms.\\n“Come, that’s enough, my squirrel! That’s enough, my wild pony!” said\\nold Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight. “Pick up my knitting.”\\nBoth of them had forgotten what the “never” was about.\\nVIII\\nThe sun was still full on the garden when the back door of the\\nBurnells’ shut with a bang, and a very gay figure walked down the path\\nto the gate. It was Alice, the servant-girl, dressed for her afternoon\\nout. She wore a white cotton dress with such large red spots on it and\\nso many that they made you shudder, white shoes and a leghorn turned up\\nunder the brim with poppies. Of course she wore gloves, white ones,\\nstained at the fastenings with iron-mould, and in one hand she carried\\na very dashed-looking sunshade which she referred to as her\\n“perishall.”\\nBeryl, sitting in the window, fanning her freshly-washed hair, thought\\nshe had never seen such a guy. If Alice had only blacked her face with\\na piece of cork before she started out, the picture would have been\\ncomplete. And where did a girl like that go to in a place like this?\\nThe heart-shaped Fijian fan beat scornfully at that lovely bright mane.\\nShe supposed Alice had picked up some horrible common larrikin and\\nthey’d go off into the bush together. Pity to have made herself so\\nconspicuous; they’d have hard work to hide with Alice in that rig-out.\\nBut no, Beryl was unfair. Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs, who’d\\nsent her an “invite” by the little boy who called for orders. She had\\ntaken ever such a liking to Mrs. Stubbs ever since the first time she\\nwent to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes.\\n“Dear heart!” Mrs. Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side. “I never\\nseen anyone so eaten. You might have been attacked by canningbals.”\\nAlice did wish there’d been a bit of life on the road though. Made her\\nfeel so queer, having nobody behind her. Made her feel all weak in the\\nspine. She couldn’t believe that some one wasn’t watching her. And yet\\nit was silly to turn round; it gave you away. She pulled up her gloves,\\nhummed to herself and said to the distant gum-tree, “Shan’t be long\\nnow.” But that was hardly company.\\nMrs. Stubbs’s shop was perched on a little hillock just off the road.\\nIt had two big windows for eyes, a broad veranda for a hat, and the\\nsign on the roof, scrawled MRS. STUBBS’S, was like a little card stuck\\nrakishly in the hat crown.\\nOn the veranda there hung a long string of bathing-dresses, clinging\\ntogether as though they’d just been rescued from the sea rather than\\nwaiting to go in, and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so\\nextraordinarily mixed that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and\\nforcibly separate at least fifty. Even then it was the rarest thing to\\nfind the left that belonged to the right. So many people had lost\\npatience and gone off with one shoe that fitted and one that was a\\nlittle too big…. Mrs. Stubbs prided herself on keeping something of\\neverything. The two windows, arranged in the form of precarious\\npyramids, were crammed so tight, piled so high, that it seemed only a\\nconjurer could prevent them from toppling over. In the left-hand corner\\nof one window, glued to the pane by four gelatine lozenges, there\\nwas—and there had been from time immemorial—a notice.\\n LOST! HANSOME GOLE BROOCH\\n SOLID GOLD\\n ON OR NEAR BEACH\\n REWARD OFFERED\\n\\nAlice pressed open the door. The bell jangled, the red serge curtains\\nparted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. With her broad smile and the long\\nbacon knife in her hand, she looked like a friendly brigand. Alice was\\nwelcomed so warmly that she found it quite difficult to keep up her\\n“manners.” They consisted of persistent little coughs and hems, pulls\\nat her gloves, tweaks at her skirt, and a curious difficulty in seeing\\nwhat was set before her or understanding what was said.\\nTea was laid on the parlour table—ham, sardines, a whole pound of\\nbutter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an\\nadvertisement for somebody’s baking-powder. But the Primus stove roared\\nso loudly that it was useless to try to talk above it. Alice sat down\\non the edge of a basket-chair while Mrs. Stubbs pumped the stove still\\nhigher. Suddenly Mrs. Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and\\ndisclosed a large brown-paper parcel.\\n“I’ve just had some new photers taken, my dear,” she shouted cheerfully\\nto Alice. “Tell me what you think of them.”\\nIn a very dainty, refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue\\nback from the first one. Life! How many there were! There were three\\ndozzing at least. And she held it up to the light.\\nMrs. Stubbs sat in an arm-chair, leaning very much to one side. There\\nwas a look of mild astonishment on her large face, and well there might\\nbe. For though the arm-chair stood on a carpet, to the left of it,\\nmiraculously skirting the carpet-border, there was a dashing\\nwater-fall. On her right stood a Grecian pillar with a giant fern-tree\\non either side of it, and in the background towered a gaunt mountain,\\npale with snow.\\n“It is a nice style, isn’t it?” shouted Mrs. Stubbs; and Alice had just\\nscreamed “Sweetly” when the roaring of the Primus stove died down,\\nfizzled out, ceased, and she said “Pretty” in a silence that was\\nfrightening.\\n“Draw up your chair, my dear,” said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour out.\\n“Yes,” she said thoughtfully, as she handed the tea, “but I don’t care\\nabout the size. I’m having an enlargemint. All very well for Christmas\\ncards, but I never was the one for small photers myself. You get no\\ncomfort out of them. To say the truth, I find them dis’eartening.”\\nAlice quite saw what she meant.\\n“Size,” said Mrs. Stubbs. “Give me size. That was what my poor dear\\nhusband was always saying. He couldn’t stand anything small. Gave him\\nthe creeps. And, strange as it may seem, my dear”—here Mrs. Stubbs\\ncreaked and seemed to expand herself at the memory—“it was dropsy that\\ncarried him off at the larst. Many’s the time they drawn one and a half\\npints from ’im at the ’ospital… It seemed like a judgmint.”\\nAlice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him. She\\nventured, “I suppose it was water.”\\nBut Mrs. Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly, “It\\nwas liquid, my dear.”\\nLiquid! Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it,\\nnosing and wary.\\n“That’s ’im!” said Mrs. Stubbs, and she pointed dramatically to the\\nlife-size head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead white rose in\\nthe buttonhole of his coat that made you think of a curl of cold\\nmutting fat. Just below, in silver letters on a red cardboard ground,\\nwere the words, “Be not afraid, it is I.”\\n“It’s ever such a fine face,” said Alice faintly.\\nThe pale-blue bow on the top of Mrs. Stubbs’s fair frizzy hair\\nquivered. She arched her plump neck. What a neck she had! It was bright\\npink where it began and then it changed to warm apricot, and that faded\\nto the colour of a brown egg and then to a deep creamy.\\n“All the same, my dear,” she said surprisingly, “freedom’s best!” Her\\nsoft, fat chuckle sounded like a purr. “Freedom’s best,” said Mrs.\\nStubbs again.\\nFreedom! Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. She felt awkward. Her\\nmind flew back to her own kitching. Ever so queer! She wanted to be\\nback in it again.\\nIX\\nA strange company assembled in the Burnells’ washhouse after tea. Round\\nthe table there sat a bull, a rooster, a donkey that kept forgetting it\\nwas a donkey, a sheep and a bee. The washhouse was the perfect place\\nfor such a meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked,\\nand nobody ever interrupted. It was a small tin shed standing apart\\nfrom the bungalow. Against the wall there was a deep trough and in the\\ncorner a copper with a basket of clothes-pegs on top of it. The little\\nwindow, spun over with cobwebs, had a piece of candle and a mouse-trap\\non the dusty sill. There were clotheslines criss-crossed overhead and,\\nhanging from a peg on the wall, a very big, a huge, rusty horseshoe.\\nThe table was in the middle with a form at either side.\\n“You can’t be a bee, Kezia. A bee’s not an animal. It’s a ninseck.”\\n“Oh, but I do want to be a bee frightfully,” wailed Kezia…. A tiny\\nbee, all yellow-furry, with striped legs. She drew her legs up under\\nher and leaned over the table. She felt she was a bee.\\n“A ninseck must be an animal,” she said stoutly. “It makes a noise.\\nIt’s not like a fish.”\\n“I’m a bull, I’m a bull!” cried Pip. And he gave such a tremendous\\nbellow—how did he make that noise?—that Lottie looked quite alarmed.\\n“I’ll be a sheep,” said little Rags. “A whole lot of sheep went past\\nthis morning.”\\n“How do you know?”\\n“Dad heard them. Baa!” He sounded like the little lamb that trots\\nbehind and seems to wait to be carried.\\n“Cock-a-doodle-do!” shrilled Isabel. With her red cheeks and bright\\neyes she looked like a rooster.\\n“What’ll I be?” Lottie asked everybody, and she sat there smiling,\\nwaiting for them to decide for her. It had to be an easy one.\\n“Be a donkey, Lottie.” It was Kezia’s suggestion. “Hee-haw! You can’t\\nforget that.”\\n“Hee-haw!” said Lottie solemnly. “When do I have to say it?”\\n“I’ll explain, I’ll explain,” said the bull. It was he who had the\\ncards. He waved them round his head. “All be quiet! All listen!” And he\\nwaited for them. “Look here, Lottie.” He turned up a card. “It’s got\\ntwo spots on it—see? Now, if you put that card in the middle and\\nsomebody else has one with two spots as well, you say ‘Hee-haw,’ and\\nthe card’s yours.”\\n“Mine?” Lottie was round-eyed. “To keep?”\\n“No, silly. Just for the game, see? Just while we’re playing.” The bull\\nwas very cross with her.\\n“Oh, Lottie, you are a little silly,” said the proud rooster.\\nLottie looked at both of them. Then she hung her head; her lip\\nquivered. “I don’t want to play,” she whispered. The others glanced at\\none another like conspirators. All of them knew what that meant. She\\nwould go away and be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny\\nthrown over her head, in a corner, or against a wall, or even behind a\\nchair.\\n“Yes, you do, Lottie. It’s quite easy,” said Kezia.\\nAnd Isabel, repentant, said exactly like a grown-up, “Watch me,\\nLottie, and you’ll soon learn.”\\n“Cheer up, Lot,” said Pip. “There, I know what I’ll do. I’ll give you\\nthe first one. It’s mine, really, but I’ll give it to you. Here you\\nare.” And he slammed the card down in front of Lottie.\\nLottie revived at that. But now she was in another difficulty. “I\\nhaven’t got a hanky,” she said; “I want one badly, too.”\\n“Here, Lottie, you can use mine.” Rags dipped into his sailor blouse\\nand brought up a very wet-looking one, knotted together. “Be very\\ncareful,” he warned her. “Only use that corner. Don’t undo it. I’ve got\\na little starfish inside I’m going to try and tame.”\\n“Oh, come on, you girls,” said the bull. “And mind—you’re not to look\\nat your cards. You’ve got to keep your hands under the table till I say\\n‘Go.’”\\nSmack went the cards round the table. They tried with all their might\\nto see, but Pip was too quick for them. It was very exciting, sitting\\nthere in the washhouse; it was all they could do not to burst into a\\nlittle chorus of animals before Pip had finished dealing.\\n“Now, Lottie, you begin.”\\nTimidly Lottie stretched out a hand, took the top card off her pack,\\nhad a good look at it—it was plain she was counting the spots—and put\\nit down.\\n“No, Lottie, you can’t do that. You mustn’t look first. You must turn\\nit the other way over.”\\n“But then everybody will see it the same time as me,” said Lottie.\\nThe game proceeded. Mooe-ooo-er! The bull was terrible. He charged over\\nthe table and seemed to eat the cards up.\\nBss-ss! said the bee.\\nCock-a-doodle-do! Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her\\nelbows like wings.\\nBaa! Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the\\none they called the King of Spain. She had hardly any cards left.\\n“Why don’t you call out, Lottie?”\\n“I’ve forgotten what I am,” said the donkey woefully.\\n“Well, change! Be a dog instead! Bow-wow!”\\n“Oh yes. That’s much easier.” Lottie smiled again. But when she and\\nKezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose. The others made signs to\\nLottie and pointed. Lottie turned very red; she looked bewildered, and\\nat last she said, “Hee-haw! Ke-zia.”\\n“Ss! Wait a minute!” They were in the very thick of it when the bull\\nstopped them, holding up his hand. “What’s that? What’s that noise?”\\n“What noise? What do you mean?” asked the rooster.\\n“Ss! Shut up! Listen!” They were mouse-still. “I thought I heard a—a\\nsort of knocking,” said the bull.\\n“What was it like?” asked the sheep faintly.\\nNo answer.\\nThe bee gave a shudder. “Whatever did we shut the door for?” she said\\nsoftly. Oh, why, why had they shut the door?\\nWhile they were playing, the day had faded; the gorgeous sunset had\\nblazed and died. And now the quick dark came racing over the sea, over\\nthe sand-hills, up the paddock. You were frightened to look in the\\ncorners of the washhouse, and yet you had to look with all your might.\\nAnd somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp. The blinds were\\nbeing pulled down; the kitchen fire leapt in the tins on the\\nmantelpiece.\\n“It would be awful now,” said the bull, “if a spider was to fall from\\nthe ceiling on to the table, wouldn’t it?”\\n“Spiders don’t fall from ceilings.”\\n“Yes, they do. Our Min told us she’d seen a spider as big as a saucer,\\nwith long hairs on it like a gooseberry.”\\nQuickly all the little heads were jerked up; all the little bodies drew\\ntogether, pressed together.\\n“Why doesn’t somebody come and call us?” cried the rooster.\\nOh, those grown-ups, laughing and snug, sitting in the lamp-light,\\ndrinking out of cups! They’d forgotten about them. No, not really\\nforgotten. That was what their smile meant. They had decided to leave\\nthem there all by themselves.\\nSuddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off\\nthe forms, all of them screamed too. “A face—a face looking!” shrieked\\nLottie.\\nIt was true, it was real. Pressed against the window was a pale face,\\nblack eyes, a black beard.\\n“Grandma! Mother! Somebody!”\\nBut they had not got to the door, tumbling over one another, before it\\nopened for Uncle Jonathan. He had come to take the little boys home.\\nX\\nHe had meant to be there before, but in the front garden he had come\\nupon Linda walking up and down the grass, stopping to pick off a dead\\npink or give a top-heavy carnation something to lean against, or to\\ntake a deep breath of something, and then walking on again, with her\\nlittle air of remoteness. Over her white frock she wore a yellow,\\npink-fringed shawl from the Chinaman’s shop.\\n“Hallo, Jonathan!” called Linda. And Jonathan whipped off his shabby\\npanama, pressed it against his breast, dropped on one knee, and kissed\\nLinda’s hand.\\n“Greeting, my Fair One! Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom!” boomed\\nthe bass voice gently. “Where are the other noble dames?”\\n“Beryl’s out playing bridge and mother’s giving the boy his bath….\\nHave you come to borrow something?”\\nThe Trouts were for ever running out of things and sending across to\\nthe Burnells’ at the last moment.\\nBut Jonathan only answered, “A little love, a little kindness;” and he\\nwalked by his sister-in-law’s side.\\nLinda dropped into Beryl’s hammock under the manuka-tree, and Jonathan\\nstretched himself on the grass beside her, pulled a long stalk and\\nbegan chewing it. They knew each other well. The voices of children\\ncried from the other gardens. A fisherman’s light cart shook along the\\nsandy road, and from far away they heard a dog barking; it was muffled\\nas though the dog had its head in a sack. If you listened you could\\njust hear the soft swish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles.\\nThe sun was sinking.\\n“And so you go back to the office on Monday, do you, Jonathan?” asked\\nLinda.\\n“On Monday the cage door opens and clangs to upon the victim for\\nanother eleven months and a week,” answered Jonathan.\\nLinda swung a little. “It must be awful,” she said slowly.\\n“Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister? Would ye have me weep?”\\nLinda was so accustomed to Jonathan’s way of talking that she paid no\\nattention to it.\\n“I suppose,” she said vaguely, “one gets used to it. One gets used to\\nanything.”\\n“Does one? Hum!” The “Hum” was so deep it seemed to boom from\\nunderneath the ground. “I wonder how it’s done,” brooded Jonathan;\\n“I’ve never managed it.”\\nLooking at him as he lay there, Linda thought again how attractive he\\nwas. It was strange to think that he was only an ordinary clerk, that\\nStanley earned twice as much money as he. What was the matter with\\nJonathan? He had no ambition; she supposed that was it. And yet one\\nfelt he was gifted, exceptional. He was passionately fond of music;\\nevery spare penny he had went on books. He was always full of new\\nideas, schemes, plans. But nothing came of it all. The new fire blazed\\nin Jonathan; you almost heard it roaring softly as he explained,\\ndescribed and dilated on the new thing; but a moment later it had\\nfallen in and there was nothing but ashes, and Jonathan went about with\\na look like hunger in his black eyes. At these times he exaggerated his\\nabsurd manner of speaking, and he sang in church—he was the leader of\\nthe choir—with such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn\\nput on an unholy splendour.\\n“It seems to me just as imbecile, just as infernal, to have to go to\\nthe office on Monday,” said Jonathan, “as it always has done and always\\nwill do. To spend all the best years of one’s life sitting on a stool\\nfrom nine to five, scratching in somebody’s ledger! It’s a queer use to\\nmake of one’s… one and only life, isn’t it? Or do I fondly dream?” He\\nrolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda. “Tell me, what is the\\ndifference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner. The only\\ndifference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobody’s ever\\ngoing to let me out. That’s a more intolerable situation than the\\nother. For if I’d been—pushed in, against my will—kicking, even—once\\nthe door was locked, or at any rate in five years or so, I might have\\naccepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of flies\\nor counting the warder’s steps along the passage with particular\\nattention to variations of tread and so on. But as it is, I’m like an\\ninsect that’s flown into a room of its own accord. I dash against the\\nwalls, dash against the windows, flop against the ceiling, do\\neverything on God’s earth, in fact, except fly out again. And all the\\nwhile I’m thinking, like that moth, or that butterfly, or whatever it\\nis, ‘The shortness of life! The shortness of life!’ I’ve only one night\\nor one day, and there’s this vast dangerous garden, waiting out there,\\nundiscovered, unexplored.”\\n“But, if you feel like that, why—” began Linda quickly.\\n“Ah!” cried Jonathan. And that “ah!” was somehow almost exultant.\\n“There you have me. Why? Why indeed? There’s the maddening, mysterious\\nquestion. Why don’t I fly out again? There’s the window or the door or\\nwhatever it was I came in by. It’s not hopelessly shut—is it? Why don’t\\nI find it and be off? Answer me that, little sister.” But he gave her\\nno time to answer.\\n“I’m exactly like that insect again. For some reason”—Jonathan paused\\nbetween the words—“it’s not allowed, it’s forbidden, it’s against the\\ninsect law, to stop banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even\\nfor an instant. Why don’t I leave the office? Why don’t I seriously\\nconsider, this moment, for instance, what it is that prevents me\\nleaving? It’s not as though I’m tremendously tied. I’ve two boys to\\nprovide for, but, after all, they’re boys. I could cut off to sea, or\\nget a job up-country, or—” Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in a\\nchanged voice, as if he were confiding a secret, “Weak… weak. No\\nstamina. No anchor. No guiding principle, let us call it.” But then the\\ndark velvety voice rolled out:\\n Would ye hear the story\\n How it unfolds itself. . .\\n\\nand they were silent.\\nThe sun had set. In the western sky there were great masses of\\ncrushed-up rose-coloured clouds. Broad beams of light shone through the\\nclouds and beyond them as if they would cover the whole sky. Overhead\\nthe blue faded; it turned a pale gold, and the bush outlined against it\\ngleamed dark and brilliant like metal. Sometimes when those beams of\\nlight show in the sky they are very awful. They remind you that up\\nthere sits Jehovah, the jealous God, the Almighty, Whose eye is upon\\nyou, ever watchful, never weary. You remember that at His coming the\\nwhole earth will shake into one ruined graveyard; the cold, bright\\nangels will drive you this way and that, and there will be no time to\\nexplain what could be explained so simply…. But to-night it seemed to\\nLinda there was something infinitely joyful and loving in those silver\\nbeams. And now no sound came from the sea. It breathed softly as if it\\nwould draw that tender, joyful beauty into its own bosom.\\n“It’s all wrong, it’s all wrong,” came the shadowy voice of Jonathan.\\n“It’s not the scene, it’s not the setting for… three stools, three\\ndesks, three inkpots and a wire blind.”\\nLinda knew that he would never change, but she said, “Is it too late,\\neven now?”\\n“I’m old—I’m old,” intoned Jonathan. He bent towards her, he passed his\\nhand over his head. “Look!” His black hair was speckled all over with\\nsilver, like the breast plumage of a black fowl.\\nLinda was surprised. She had no idea that he was grey. And yet, as he\\nstood up beside her and sighed and stretched, she saw him, for the\\nfirst time, not resolute, not gallant, not careless, but touched\\nalready with age. He looked very tall on the darkening grass, and the\\nthought crossed her mind, “He is like a weed.”\\nJonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers.\\n“Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine,” he murmured. “I must go\\nseek those heirs to my fame and fortune….” He was gone.\\nXI\\nLight shone in the windows of the bungalow. Two square patches of gold\\nfell upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds. Florrie, the cat, came\\nout on to the veranda, and sat on the top step, her white paws close\\ntogether, her tail curled round. She looked content, as though she had\\nbeen waiting for this moment all day.\\n“Thank goodness, it’s getting late,” said Florrie. “Thank goodness, the\\nlong day is over.” Her greengage eyes opened.\\nPresently there sounded the rumble of the coach, the crack of Kelly’s\\nwhip. It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from\\ntown, talking loudly together. It stopped at the Burnells’ gate.\\nStanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. “Is that you,\\ndarling?”\\n“Yes, Stanley.”\\nHe leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. She was\\nenfolded in that familiar, eager, strong embrace.\\n“Forgive me, darling, forgive me,” stammered Stanley, and he put his\\nhand under her chin and lifted her face to him.\\n“Forgive you?” smiled Linda. “But whatever for?”\\n“Good God! You can’t have forgotten,” cried Stanley Burnell. “I’ve\\nthought of nothing else all day. I’ve had the hell of a day. I made up\\nmy mind to dash out and telegraph, and then I thought the wire mightn’t\\nreach you before I did. I’ve been in tortures, Linda.”\\n“But, Stanley,” said Linda, “what must I forgive you for?”\\n“Linda!”—Stanley was very hurt—“didn’t you realize—you must have\\nrealized—I went away without saying good-bye to you this morning? I\\ncan’t imagine how I can have done such a thing. My confounded temper,\\nof course. But—well”—and he sighed and took her in his arms again—“I’ve\\nsuffered for it enough to-day.”\\n“What’s that you’ve got in your hand?” asked Linda. “New gloves? Let me\\nsee.”\\n“Oh, just a cheap pair of wash-leather ones,” said Stanley humbly. “I\\nnoticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning, so, as I was\\npassing the shop, I dashed in and got myself a pair. What are you\\nsmiling at? You don’t think it was wrong of me, do you?”\\n“On the con-trary, darling,” said Linda, “I think it was most\\nsensible.”\\nShe pulled one of the large, pale gloves on her own fingers and looked\\nat her hand, turning it this way and that. She was still smiling.\\nStanley wanted to say, “I was thinking of you the whole time I bought\\nthem.” It was true, but for some reason he couldn’t say it. “Let’s go\\nin,” said he.\\nXII\\nWhy does one feel so different at night? Why is it so exciting to be\\nawake when everybody else is asleep? Late—it is very late! And yet\\nevery moment you feel more and more wakeful, as though you were slowly,\\nalmost with every breath, waking up into a new, wonderful, far more\\nthrilling and exciting world than the daylight one. And what is this\\nqueer sensation that you’re a conspirator? Lightly, stealthily you move\\nabout your room. You take something off the dressing-table and put it\\ndown again without a sound. And everything, even the bed-post, knows\\nyou, responds, shares your secret….\\nYou’re not very fond of your room by day. You never think about it.\\nYou’re in and out, the door opens and slams, the cupboard creaks. You\\nsit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again.\\nA dive down to the glass, two pins in your hair, powder your nose and\\noff again. But now—it’s suddenly dear to you. It’s a darling little\\nfunny room. It’s yours. Oh, what a joy it is to own things! Mine—my\\nown!\\n“My very own for ever?”\\n“Yes.” Their lips met.\\nNo, of course, that had nothing to do with it. That was all nonsense\\nand rubbish. But, in spite of herself, Beryl saw so plainly two people\\nstanding in the middle of her room. Her arms were round his neck; he\\nheld her. And now he whispered, “My beauty, my little beauty!” She\\njumped off her bed, ran over to the window and kneeled on the\\nwindow-seat, with her elbows on the sill. But the beautiful night, the\\ngarden, every bush, every leaf, even the white palings, even the stars,\\nwere conspirators too. So bright was the moon that the flowers were\\nbright as by day; the shadow of the nasturtiums, exquisite lily-like\\nleaves and wide-open flowers, lay across the silvery veranda. The\\nmanuka-tree, bent by the southerly winds, was like a bird on one leg\\nstretching out a wing.\\nBut when Beryl looked at the bush, it seemed to her the bush was sad.\\n“We are dumb trees, reaching up in the night, imploring we know not\\nwhat,” said the sorrowful bush.\\nIt is true when you are by yourself and you think about life, it is\\nalways sad. All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving\\nyou, and it’s as though, in the silence, somebody called your name, and\\nyou heard your name for the first time. “Beryl!”\\n“Yes, I’m here. I’m Beryl. Who wants me?”\\n“Beryl!”\\n“Let me come.”\\nIt is lonely living by oneself. Of course, there are relations,\\nfriends, heaps of them; but that’s not what she means. She wants some\\none who will find the Beryl they none of them know, who will expect her\\nto be that Beryl always. She wants a lover.\\n“Take me away from all these other people, my love. Let us go far away.\\nLet us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning. Let\\nus make our fire. Let us sit down to eat together. Let us have long\\ntalks at night.”\\nAnd the thought was almost, “Save me, my love. Save me!”\\n… “Oh, go on! Don’t be a prude, my dear. You enjoy yourself while\\nyou’re young. That’s my advice.” And a high rush of silly laughter\\njoined Mrs. Harry Kember’s loud, indifferent neigh.\\nYou see, it’s so frightfully difficult when you’ve nobody. You’re so at\\nthe mercy of things. You can’t just be rude. And you’ve always this\\nhorror of seeming inexperienced and stuffy like the other ninnies at\\nthe Bay. And—and it’s fascinating to know you’ve power over people.\\nYes, that is fascinating….\\nOh why, oh why doesn’t “he” come soon?\\nIf I go on living here, thought Beryl, anything may happen to me.\\n“But how do you know he is coming at all?” mocked a small voice within\\nher.\\nBut Beryl dismissed it. She couldn’t be left. Other people, perhaps,\\nbut not she. It wasn’t possible to think that Beryl Fairfield never\\nmarried, that lovely fascinating girl.\\n“Do you remember Beryl Fairfield?”\\n“Remember her! As if I could forget her! It was one summer at the Bay\\nthat I saw her. She was standing on the beach in a blue”—no,\\npink—“muslin frock, holding on a big cream”—no, black—“straw hat. But\\nit’s years ago now.”\\n“She’s as lovely as ever, more so if anything.”\\nBeryl smiled, bit her lip, and gazed over the garden. As she gazed, she\\nsaw somebody, a man, leave the road, step along the paddock beside\\ntheir palings as if he was coming straight towards her. Her heart beat.\\nWho was it? Who could it be? It couldn’t be a burglar, certainly not a\\nburglar, for he was smoking and he strolled lightly. Beryl’s heart\\nleapt; it seemed to turn right over, and then to stop. She recognized\\nhim.\\n“Good evening, Miss Beryl,” said the voice softly.\\n“Good evening.”\\n“Won’t you come for a little walk?” it drawled.\\nCome for a walk—at that time of night! “I couldn’t. Everybody’s in bed.\\nEverybody’s asleep.”\\n“Oh,” said the voice lightly, and a whiff of sweet smoke reached her.\\n“What does everybody matter? Do come! It’s such a fine night. There’s\\nnot a soul about.”\\nBeryl shook her head. But already something stirred in her, something\\nreared its head.\\nThe voice said, “Frightened?” It mocked, “Poor little girl!”\\n“Not in the least,” said she. As she spoke that weak thing within her\\nseemed to uncoil, to grow suddenly tremendously strong; she longed to\\ngo!\\nAnd just as if this was quite understood by the other, the voice said,\\ngently and softly, but finally, “Come along!”\\nBeryl stepped over her low window, crossed the veranda, ran down the\\ngrass to the gate. He was there before her.\\n“That’s right,” breathed the voice, and it teased, “You’re not\\nfrightened, are you? You’re not frightened?”\\nShe was; now she was here she was terrified, and it seemed to her\\neverything was different. The moonlight stared and glittered; the\\nshadows were like bars of iron. Her hand was taken.\\n“Not in the least,” she said lightly. “Why should I be?”\\nHer hand was pulled gently, tugged. She held back.\\n“No, I’m not coming any farther,” said Beryl.\\n“Oh, rot!” Harry Kember didn’t believe her. “Come along! We’ll just go\\nas far as that fuchsia bush. Come along!”\\nThe fuchsia bush was tall. It fell over the fence in a shower. There\\nwas a little pit of darkness beneath.\\n“No, really, I don’t want to,” said Beryl.\\nFor a moment Harry Kember didn’t answer. Then he came close to her,\\nturned to her, smiled and said quickly, “Don’t be silly! Don’t be\\nsilly!”\\nHis smile was something she’d never seen before. Was he drunk? That\\nbright, blind, terrifying smile froze her with horror. What was she\\ndoing? How had she got here? the stern garden asked her as the gate\\npushed open, and quick as a cat Harry Kember came through and snatched\\nher to him.\\n“Cold little devil! Cold little devil!” said the hateful voice.\\nBut Beryl was strong. She slipped, ducked, wrenched free.\\n“You are vile, vile,” said she.\\n“Then why in God’s name did you come?” stammered Harry Kember.\\nNobody answered him.\\nA cloud, small, serene, floated across the moon. In that moment of\\ndarkness the sea sounded deep, troubled. Then the cloud sailed away,\\nand the sound of the sea was a vague murmur, as though it waked out of\\na dark dream. All was still.\\n'"
